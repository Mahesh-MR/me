# All about ME

This project provides a template for a personal web page, specifically tailored
for academics. 

The design separates the presentation layer from the data layer allowing the
user to maintain a repository of their data while this project presents and
formats the data to be displayed (think Markdown or Latex). This is your typical
model-view-controller (MVC) pattern.

# Install
